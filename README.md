- State management for messages and user input  
- Dynamic message rendering   
- Basic styling for a clean UI  
- Component-based architecture for maintainability  

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building React components with **JSX**  
- Managing state using `useState`  
- Handling events and user input in React  
- Conditional rendering for dynamic content
